# TODO

****API VERSION 1.1.0****
- Rating needs to be implemented
- Implement models for Song/Artist
- Logs need to look for the daily file and append to it. Right now, it rewrites the file
- Decide on a sorting algorithm and use it for **'top'** parameter
- Replace the structure of type '/artist/name=:name/term=:term' to a more RESTful configuration like 'artist/?name=:name&term=:term'
- Replace console.logs to a json response to the client
